**Campus Saga: Your Voice Matters**

Campus Saga is an innovative social media platform designed to empower university students to raise their concerns, engage with their respective institutions, and stay informed about campus happenings. It offers four types of accounts: **student**, **university administrator**, **campus ambassador**, and **app administrator**. Each account type holds distinct roles and responsibilities to ensure a well-structured and effective communication channel between students and university authorities.

### Key Features and Roles:

#### **Student Account**
When a student encounters an issue within their university, they can anonymously post it on the Campus Saga app, providing a detailed description and categorizing it for easy identification. Students can also vote on posts, interact with university promotions, and prioritize issues through the upvote/downvote mechanism.

#### **University Administrator Account**
University administrators are granted access to review student-submitted posts, but only within their respective universities. They can mark issues as resolved, indicating that they have been addressed, or leave them unresolved, signaling the need for further attention. Students can then vote on the administrator's decision, ensuring transparency and accountability.

#### **Campus Ambassador Account** (New Role)
Campus ambassadors serve as representatives of their respective universities. They can:
- **Verify students** within their own university to maintain profile authenticity.
- Assist in moderating university-related posts, promotions, and issues.
- Collaborate with university administrators to streamline communication.
Campus ambassadors are appointed by app administrators, ensuring that the role is assigned to trustworthy and proactive individuals.

#### **App Administrator Account**
App administrators oversee the entire platform. They manage user accounts, assign campus ambassadors, and ensure that the app operates smoothly.

### **How Campus Saga Works**

1. **Posting Issues:** Students anonymously report concerns, categorized for easy identification by university administrators.
2. **Review and Resolution:** University administrators review issues and take appropriate actions. If a majority of students mark a decision as unsolved, it prompts further investigation.
3. **Promotions and Events:** Students can view promotions from any university but can only interact with those from their own institution, fostering a community-focused approach.

### **University Ranking System**
Campus Saga introduces a university ranking system based on:
- **Post resolution rate:** Percentage of resolved student issues.
- **Student-administrator engagement:** Interaction levels on the platform.
- **Problem-solving efficiency:** Timeliness and effectiveness of responses.
- **Overall student satisfaction:** Student sentiment towards university actions.

### **Profile Management**
Students can manage their personal information, such as name, email, university affiliation, and profile verification status, on a dedicated profile page. Campus ambassadors play a key role in verifying student profiles within their universities.
