"Campus Saga: Your Voice Matters

Campus Saga is an innovative social media platform designed to empower university students to raise their concerns, engage with their respective institutions, and stay informed about campus happenings. It offers three types of accounts: student, university administrator, and app administrator. Each account type holds distinct roles and responsibilities to ensure a well-structured and effective communication channel between students and university authorities.

When a student encounters an issue within their university, they can anonymously post it on the Campus Saga app, providing a detailed description and categorizing it for easy identification. University administrators are granted access to review these posts, solely within their respective universities, allowing them to stay abreast of student concerns and take appropriate action.

Upon reviewing a post, the university administrator can either mark it as resolved, indicating that the issue has been addressed, or leave it as unresolved, signaling the need for further attention. Students are then given the opportunity to vote on whether they agree with the university administrator's decision. If a majority of students mark a post as unsolved, it remains unresolved, prompting further investigation and action from the university.

Campus Saga also provides a platform for students to interact with university promotions and advertisements, keeping them informed about upcoming events, opportunities, and initiatives within their institutions. Students can view promotions from any university but can only interact with those posted by their own university, fostering a sense of community and engagement within their respective institutions.

The app's upvote/downvote mechanism empowers students to prioritize issues within their university feed, bringing the most pressing concerns to the forefront and ensuring that they receive the attention they deserve. This feature promotes transparency and accountability, fostering a collaborative environment where students and university authorities work together to address campus issues effectively.

In addition to these features, Campus Saga also offers a unique university ranking system. The app ranks universities based on various factors, including:

* Post resolution rate: This metric measures the percentage of student issues that have been resolved by university administrators.

* Student-administrator engagement: This metric assesses the level of interaction between students and university administrators on the platform.

* Problem-solving efficiency: This metric evaluates the timeliness and effectiveness of university administrators' responses to student issues.

* Overall student satisfaction: This metric gauges the overall sentiment of students towards the university's handling of campus issues.

By considering these factors, Campus Saga provides a comprehensive and transparent ranking system that empowers students to make informed decisions about their university choices.

Furthermore, the app includes a dedicated profile page where university students can view and edit their personal information, including their name, email address, associated university, and profile verification status. This feature ensures that student profiles remain accurate and up-to-date.

Campus Saga is a powerful tool that empowers university students to raise their voices, engage with their institutions, and stay informed about campus happenings. Its innovative features, such as its university ranking system and comprehensive profile management, make it an essential resource for any university student looking to make a positive impact on their campus community."
